My dataset represents the most streamed songs of 2024 on Spotify along it comes with various information about the sound from other platforms. I found this dataset posted on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024/data. 
I performed various pandas operations such as using head(), info(), describe() to get the basic information about the dataset. As well, I used .loc and .Iloc to search through rows, columns and specific cells from the dataset. I also used pandas to filter the dataset and to create and drop colons also split apply combining operation 
What I learned from the dataset is different from what I thought original the dataset was going to be. I thought it was going to be popular steamed songs on Spotify that came out in 2024 but instead it’s the most steam strong form 2024 meaning it could be any sone reason on Spotify 
There was some limitation on my dataset, the major one being that sometimes the data would have some encoding errors meaning sometimes there would be errors or glitches in the names of songs and albums in the output. The second problem was some of the columns were not in right data type, so I had to go in and convert them myself if I wanted to use them properly.
